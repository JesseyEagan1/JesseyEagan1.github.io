  <p>I once worked for a Middle Eastern princess in Amman, Jordan. True story. I'd like to tell you about it...but what's important now is that I live in CO and totally geek out about code!</p>

  <!--<p>But I stayed true to my word. After being accepted into RefactorU my husband and I did the courageous act of selling our home, moving the family out West and jumping right into the world of coding by attending bootcamp.</p>-->

  <!--<p>I’m glad that I made this change for my family, and for myself - finding a career I love & thrive in, and for the software engineering field. I’m trying to improve the odds for women in coding.</p>-->

  <!--<p>I have a passion for wanting to empower more women to follow their dreams and not let their path, age or gender stand in the way. I want to give a percentage of my first year’s salary to help fund small scholarships for women entering the field.</p>-->

  <p>I have a Bachelor’s in Elementary education, but decided this past summer to make a mid-life career change into the world of web development. I was tired of living paycheck to paycheck and wanted to find a way to support my family. This isn’t an easy thing to do when you’re a mom of young children with planted roots in your hometown.</p>

  <p>But I stayed true to my word. After being accepted into RefactorU my husband and I did the courageous act of selling our home in Illinois, moving the family out West and jumping right into the world of coding by attending bootcamp.</p>

  <p>I’m glad that I made this change for my family, and for myself - finding a career I love & thrive in, and for the software engineering field. I’m trying to improve the odds for women in coding.</p>
